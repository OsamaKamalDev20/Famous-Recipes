# ðŸš€ Recipe App! ðŸ¥—ðŸ“±
Recipe App, which I built using Flutter. This app integrates APIs seamlessly to deliver an amazing experience for fetching and displaying recipes dynamically.

## ðŸ’¡ Features of the Recipe App:

### âœ… API Integration: 
Leveraged the "https://lnkd.in/dm3B5Neq" to fetch real-time recipe data.

### âœ… Dynamic UI: 
Recipes are displayed with their titles, descriptions, and tags fetched directly from the API.

### âœ… Tag Filters: 
Users can explore recipes by tags, calories, and detailed screen (ingredients, instructions, cooking and preparation times, serving, meal types, ratings, and reviews).

## ðŸ’¡ Tools Used:

### âœ… Flutter Framework:
Created a responsive and visually appealing UI for Android and iOS.
### âœ… HTTP Integration:
Utilized the http package to fetch data from the API.
### âœ… Custom Widgets:
Built dynamic and reusable components for consistency.
